					<p>
						Hey there! If you're thinking about whether or not to start coding, let me tell you, it's worth giving
						it a shot. While technology might not be your cup of tea, coding offers a plethora of benefits that go
						beyond just understanding tech. For starters, coding can improve your problem-solving skills and boost
						your creativity. It can also help you gain a deeper understanding of how things work and develop a
						logical thought process. Additionally, coding skills are highly sought after in many industries, so it
						can be a valuable asset to have on your resume. And who knows, you might even discover a passion for
						coding and tech along the way. So, give coding a chance and see where it takes you! <br /><br />
						Programming is an industry that is constantly evolving, with new career paths appearing every day that
						may suit you. It may seem daunting at first when you open an editor and freeze in front of all the
						options in front of you, but remember that everyone starts somewhere. The best way to maintain
						motivation in learing a programming language is think of something that you'd like to do, then learn how
						to do it.
